    <h2>Roger Lingard</h2>
    <p>Hi I’m Roger and I’m currently majoring in Computer Science. I’m an incoming Freshman who’s still trying to get the hang of things around the university, though from what I’ve seen I really like how classes are done here at BYUI. I love to learn and I’m glad that I am able to take a lot of classes to be able to gain more knowledge.</p>
    <p>One of the things I like to do most is to play video games. I mainly play games with my brothers when I have the chance. I also like to play the piano as one of my hobbies. I still need to improve and get better at it but the most important thing I find is practice. I also like to collect things like plushies or some random things. I also like to watch YouTube videos but I’m finding that I have less and less leisure time as I have a lot of college work to do.</p>
