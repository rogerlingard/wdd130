                <p>Miniatures: The first thing you'll need are the miniatures themselves. These can be plastic or resin
                    figurines, depending on your preference and the models you want to paint.

                <p>Paints: High-quality acrylic paints designed for miniatures are essential. Brands like Citadel,
                    Vallejo, Army Painter, and Reaper Miniatures produce paints specifically for this hobby. These
                    paints come in a wide range of colors.

                <p>Paintbrushes: Invest in a set of high-quality paintbrushes designed for miniature painting. You'll
                    want a variety of brush sizes for different tasks, including base coating, layering, and fine
                    detailing. Look for brushes with fine tips and a good spring to maintain their shape.

                <p>
                    Palette: A palette, either a traditional one or a wet palette, is used to mix and thin your paints
                    as you work. A wet palette helps keep your paints moist and usable for longer periods.

                <p>
                    Water or Thinner: You'll need water to clean your brushes and thin your paints when necessary. Some
                    painters use acrylic paint thinners for certain techniques.

                <p>
                    Primer: Use a primer to prepare the miniature's surface for painting. Priming helps the paint adhere
                    better and provides a consistent base color. Choose a color that complements your color scheme.

                <p>
                    Nippers: You will soon learn that your miniatures come on sprues and that the best way to get them
                    off the sprue is using flat edged hobby nippers. They will make sure that your plastic model will
                    come off nice and smoothly, you donâ€™t want to cut off more of the model than needed to.

                <p>
                    Hobby Knife: A sharp hobby knife is handy for cleaning mold lines, removing unwanted material, and
                    making minor modifications to the miniatures.

                    Holder or Stand: A miniature holder or stand can help you keep a steady hand while painting and
                    prevent smudging.
