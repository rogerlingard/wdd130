                <h3 class="sub-title-text">A technique used to build up smooth transitions of color, highlights, and shadows on a
                miniature.</h3>

                <h3>Materials Needed:</h3>

                <p>Miniature </p>
                <p>Acrylic paints in the desired colors</p>
                <p>Brushes, including a detail brush</p>
                <p>Water or acrylic paint thinner (for thinning paints)</p>
                <p>Palette or wet palette</p>
                <p>Steps:</p>

                <p>Basecoat: Start with a clean and properly primed miniature. Apply the basecoat, which is the initial
                layer of paint, using the darkest color for the area you are working on. This serves as the foundation
                for your layering.</p>

                <p>Select Highlight Color: Choose a lighter color (a shade or two lighter than the basecoat) for your first
                layer of highlights.</p>

                <p>Thin the Paint: To create a smooth transition, thin down the highlight color with water or a paint
                medium. The paint should be semi-translucent, like heavy cream.</p>

                <p> the First Layer: Load a small amount of thinned highlight paint on your brush. Apply this layer to
                the area where you want the first highlight, typically the raised portions or areas that catch more
                light.</p>

                <p>Blend the Edges: As you apply the thinned paint, blend the edges of the first layer into the basecoat.
                Use a gentle, controlled brushstroke to achieve a smooth transition. Feather the paint outwards so that
                it gradually fades into the basecoat. </p>

                <p>Wait for Drying: Allow this layer to dry completely before moving on to the next. This ensures that the
                layers won't mix and create a muddy appearance.</p>

                <p>Repeat the Process: Apply subsequent layers of highlights, each lighter than the last, in smaller and
                smaller areas. This gradually builds up the transition and intensity of the highlights. Continue
                blending the edges to ensure smooth transitions.</p>

                <p>Detail Work: Use a fine detail brush for the final, brightest highlights on the miniature. Apply these
                sparingly to the most prominent raised areas or where you want to draw the most attention.</p>

                <p>Shading: To add shadows, you can follow a similar process but use slightly darker colors for shading.
                Thin them down and apply them to the recessed areas and the areas you want to appear darker.</p>

                <p>Final Touches: Once you're satisfied with the layering, you can make final adjustments and details as
                needed. This might include adding accents, refining highlights, or correcting any imperfections.</p>

            <h2 class="title-text">Dry Brushing Miniature Painting Process:</h2>

            <h3 class="sub-title-text">Dry brushing is a technique used to highlight raised details and create texture on a miniature's
                surface.
            </h3>

            <h3>Materials Needed:</h3>

            <p>Miniature</p>
            <p>Acrylic paints (a lighter color for dry brushing)</p>
            <p>Stiff, flat brush (often a "drybrush" brush)</p>
            <p>Paper towel or cloth</p>
            <p>Palette</p>
            <p>Steps:</p>
            <p>
                Preparation: Start with a clean and properly primed miniature.
            </p>
            <p>
                Loading the Brush: Dip the tip of the flat, stiff brush into the lighter paint color. Unlike other
                techniques, you don't need to thin the paint; instead, you want the brush to be almost dry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Removing Excess Paint: Wipe off most of the paint onto a paper towel or cloth. The goal is to have very
                little paint remaining on the brush.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dry Brushing: Gently and lightly brush the model's surface with the nearly dry brush. Hold the brush at
                a low angle to the surface and use a back-and-forth or circular motion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Focus on Raised Details: Dry brushing highlights the raised areas, edges, and textures on the miniature.
                The paint will catch on these raised parts, creating a natural highlight effect.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gradual Build-Up: It's crucial to build up the highlights gradually. After one pass, assess the results
                and decide if you want to add more layers of dry brushing. You can also vary the pressure to control the
                intensity of the effect.
            </p>
            <p>
                Texture and Details: Dry brushing is particularly effective for creating texture on surfaces like fur,
                stone, or chainmail. It can be used for terrain pieces or models that benefit from a weathered look.
            </p>

            <p>
                Cleanup: After dry brushing, you may need to touch up or clean up any areas where the paint strayed
                outside the intended highlight areas.
            </p>

                Both layering and dry brushing are valuable techniques in the world of miniature painting. They serve
                different purposes, with layering being ideal for smooth transitions and blending, and dry brushing for
                creating texture and adding quick highlights. You can often use them in combination to achieve the
                desired effect on your miniatures. Practice and experimentation will help you master these techniques
                and produce stunning results.
